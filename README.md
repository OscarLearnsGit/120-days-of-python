# 120-days-of-python-for-SOC

**Day 1: Simple Calculator**  
Command-line arithmetic calculator supporting +, -, *, / operations with float support, result rounding to 3 decimals, and operator validation. First project learning Python basics.

**Day 2: IP Address Checker**  
Reads a list of IP addresses from a file and checks if a user-specified IP exists in that list. Demonstrates file I/O, string comparison, and basic network security validation.

**Day 3: Functions and Scope**
